# possible-quantum-cloning
Q# program which implements a toffoli gate which apparently clones a quantum state.


Using a Toffoli gate it is shown that under certain condition a arbitrary quantum state seems to be cloned on the third qubit of the gates (the target one).

A more detailed analisys can show that the input state is actually modified by the action of the gate which result then in a pair of entangled qubits.
